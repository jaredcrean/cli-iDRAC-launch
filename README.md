# iDRAC command line console launch


* This will ask you for your user name and password of the iDRAC console and launch it for you. No need to download the .jlnp file!
* I have built in the java keyboard fix from https://github.com/teichopsia/idrac-kvm-keyboard-fix to fix the keyboard input issues.
